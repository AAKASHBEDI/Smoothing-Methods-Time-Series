# Smoothing-Methods-Time-Series

The smoothing techniques are the members of time series forecasting methods or algorithms, which use the weighted average of a past observation to predict the future values or forecast the new value.Smoothing is usually done to help us better see patterns, trends for example, in time series. Generally smooth out the irregular roughness to see a clearer signal.Smoothing of time series allows extracting a signal and forecasting future values.
